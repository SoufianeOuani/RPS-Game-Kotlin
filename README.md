# RPS-Game-Kotlin
Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Kotlin.
# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game (Kotlin)

A simple console-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game built entirely in **Kotlin**.  
This project is a rewrite of the classic game previously made in C++,  
showcasing the use of **functions**, **`enum class`**, and **`data class`** in Kotlin — all without OOP inheritance.
